# Advent of Code
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.


Every year since 2015, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) has published 2 puzzles every day in the 25 days leading up to Christmas. Each day, players are provided a single personlized input which is used to solve both puzzles that day, and the user must divine the correct answer to each puzzle in order, using their personalized input. This project collects my solutions accross multiple years of Advent of Code and multiple languages. 

The folders named for a language contain solutions written in that given language. The numbered yearly folders contain my personalized inputs for each day for the given year. Instructions for running the code can be found within each of the language folders.
